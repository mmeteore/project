# project
We have created a website (named e-encyclopedia). On this site a member can register, interact with other members. For example, he can publish an article on various subjects (science, math, history, economics, literature, sport ...). Other Internet users registered on our site can read the contents, give their opinion via the comment section, put "likes" under each article.
There is also a page for registration and login on our site, once a user is logged in, he will be automatically redirected to his profile page. On this one, the latter can modify his pseudonym, update his profile picture, change his password, as well as the theme (dark or light). A user who is not a member of our site, does not benefit from these options, he can still read an article.

We have created a system of articles, where each subject is categorized. In order for the user to easily find an article, an auto-completion search bar is available (the principle is that as soon as a user types a character into the field, a search is immediately performed and returned to the browser. The latter then displays the results in a small box under the search box, and the displayed results can be scrolled by the mouse cursor.If one of the results listed is selected, the user will be redirected to this article! ). Finally, in case of forgotten password, a user can always recover his account via the email that will be communicated.
